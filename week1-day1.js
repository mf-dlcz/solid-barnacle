//Problem 2
/**
 * What are the three different ways you can declare a variable? And what is the differences
 * between them?
 *
 * var = has a global scope which means it can be accessed anywhere in the program. (never use because it can cause problems since it can be reassigned)
 * const = is locally scoped and can't be reassigned.
 * let = is locally scoped and it can be reassigned.
 */

//Problem 3

/**
 * First-Class Function (means it's assigned to a variable)
 * const helloWorld = () {
 * }
 *
 * Higher-Order Function (is a function that can accept another function as an argument)
 * *Callback function
 * const anotherNum = () {
 * }
 *
 * const num = anotherNum => {
 *      anotherNum()            <------ This is my callback function
 * }
 */

//Problem 4
/**
 * const a = 'hi';
 * console.log(c);          <------- cannot be accessed because (c) is in a different scope (undefined)
 *
 * const someFunction = (arg) => {
 * const b = 'bye';
 *
 *  if (arg) {
 *    const c = 'see ya!';
 *      console.log(a);       <------- can be accessed because (a) is globally scoped variable
 *      console.log(b);       <------- can be accessed because we're going inside out and they're both inside the same function
 * }
